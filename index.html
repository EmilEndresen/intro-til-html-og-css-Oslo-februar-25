                  The name shoebill comes from the shape of their bill, which
                  looks a bit like a Dutch clog shoe. <br />But taxonomists who
                  described it also thought the bill shape resembled the head of
                  a baleen whale, and named the species Balaeniceps rex—which
                  means “whale-head king.” Other informal names for these birds
                  are the boat bill, the bog bird, and the swamp king.
